# Script Description

#### This Bash script is designed to automate the reconnaissance process for a given target domain or IP address. 
#### It performs a series of scans and checks to gather information about open ports, services, subdomains, and SSL/TLS vulnerabilities.

## Prerequisites

#### Before running this script, ensure the following tools are installed and available in your system's PATH:
- **Nmap**: For network exploration and security auditing.
- **GoBuster**: A tool used to brute-force URIs (directories and files) on a web server.
- **SSLScan**: A fast SSL/TLS scanner that checks for vulnerabilities.
- **Sublist3r**: A subdomain discovery tool.

## Usage

```bash
./vuln_scan.sh <target_domain_or_ip>
```

#### Replace `<target_domain_or_ip>` with the domain or IP address you want to perform the reconnaissance on.

## Script Workflow

1. **Nmap Scan**: The script starts by conducting a detailed Nmap scan on all ports of the target. It identifies open ports, service versions, and the operating system.

2. **HTTP (Port 80) Analysis**: If port 80 (HTTP) is open, the script initiates a GoBuster scan to find directories and files on the web server. The results are displayed.

3. **HTTPS (Port 443) Analysis**: If port 443 (HTTPS) is open, the script performs a GoBuster scan similar to HTTP and additionally conducts an SSL/TLS vulnerability scan using SSLScan. The results of both scans are displayed.

4. **Subdomain Enumeration**: The script utilizes Sublist3r to discover subdomains of the target domain. The discovered subdomains are displayed.

5. **Service Banners Extraction**: The script extracts and displays service banners from the Nmap scan results.

## Note

- Make sure to replace `wordlist` with the actual path to your wordlist file used by GoBuster.
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to run Nmap scans and other tools against the target.
- Be responsible and respect the laws and policies governing network scanning. Unauthorized scanning of networks or systems is illegal and unethical.
